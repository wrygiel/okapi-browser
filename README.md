OKAPI Browser
=============

**OKAPI Browser** is a fork of one of my other projects (called USOS API Browser),
modified so it supports browsing and testing [OpenCaching API](http://opencaching.pl/okapi/)
methods.

*Note:* The list of available methods is dynamically fetched from the chosen
OKAPI server. The screenshot may be outdated.

Disclaimer
----------

This application is for testing purposes only. There are tons of `WebExceptions`
it doesn't even try to catch!

Having that said, I still think that it is quite useful developer tool,
especially if you're aiming for a deep understanding on how the [OKAPI
OAuth authorization](http://opencaching.pl/okapi/introduction.html#oauth)
actually works.

Installation
------------

You can use [this deployment site](http://usosphp.mimuw.edu.pl/~rygielski/okapi-browser/).
Please note, that it can be a little ahead or behind the master branch.
